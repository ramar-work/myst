create routes from the cli

create datasources from the cli

OR

create a data.json and let the cli read it


somehow handle CRUD operations



coldmvc.sh needs to handle
	listing instances (maybe...)
	creating instances	
		create the folders
		copy (or link) default assets from /share/
		orm property files
		parse json
		do some other shit...
	removing instances


coldmvc.sh also needs to hold these variables
	backend selection (usually derby, but we can change it...)
		

coldmvc.sh - other stuff...	
	some quick tests with mock data?


a couple of tests I should probably do:
	- checking banner connection (this just pings and returns a status)
		you can log it and be overcomplicated...
	- make a simple blogging system
