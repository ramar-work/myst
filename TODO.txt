files
x	create an index.cfm
-	change to use coldmvc and link with Application.cfc
		i knew this fuckshit was going to take absolutely too long...
	have a default response that shows data formatted
	have an endpoint that deletes the test crap
	have a default response for admin requests
	make it disablable from data.json
	

admin handles what?
	recreating things	
	looking at data.cfm and all properties files under db/*
	dump routes should be here too
	
	
I'm going to go back
